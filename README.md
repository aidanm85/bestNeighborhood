* This github repository contains Jupyter notebooks which analyze datasets related to parking in the city of Pittsburgh, which is used as a metric to determine the best neighborhood in the city.

Datasets: 
* https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/residential-permit-parking-program-areas/resource/e2b1ca6b-bb2e-4767-bcc9-ce305671d104
  - A dataset containing information about Pittsburgh's residential parking permits.

* https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pittsburgh-parking-meters-and-payment-points
  -  This dataset contains a list of Pittsburgh's on-street parking meters. Additionally, the list contains the neighborhood each meter is located in. By determining which neighborhoods contain the most parking meters we can estimate the availability of parking in the area.

* https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/metered-streets-pittsburgh-parking-authority/resource/9b68e71a-d117-41ad-81e1-af6965ea40f4
  -  This dataset contains a list of Pittsburgh's streets that have parking meters. The dataset also includes the neighborhood on the left and right side of the street.
By seeing which Pittsburgh neighborhood contains the most streets with meters, we can better estimate the areas that it's easier to find parking in.
